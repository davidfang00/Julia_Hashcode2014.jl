In short, the greedy approach entails cars taking turns going down one street at a time and at each junction, the cars will determine the next street to take based off the following criteria: Inspect all outgoing neighboring junctions. Out of the ones that are unvisited, the car will choose to go the junction where there is a maximum distance between its current junction and the next (while still obeying the time constraints). If all outgoing neighbors have been visited, the car will choose a random junction to go to (while still obeying the time constraints).

Under the lookahead approach, instead of the cars simply choosing the immediate street that offers the longest distance at each junction stop, the cars will now look at various paths from the current junction that contain the next 15 streets in sequence with the goal that that this path of 15 streets will be the longest distance covered in within the 15 timestamps. Thus, for each car, the greedy lookahead approach still uses a distance metric and utilizes BFS of 15 levels in oder to find the most optimal path to take at a current junction.","category":"page"},{"location":"algos/","page":"Algorithms","title":"Algorithms","text":"Like before, we want to avoid taking visited streets as much as possible in order to increase coverage so BFS first looks through candidates of outgoing neighboring junctions to take that are unvisited.

The rationale behind utilizing the fandown method stems from the fact that the headquarters is not located in the center of the map (it is in the upper left corner). Having a greedy lookahead approach start for the cars with this original starting point would not be ideal in terms of coverage because the cars would be disproportionately traversing the upper left corner area. ","category":"page"},{"location":"algos/","page":"Algorithms","title":"Algorithms","text":"Thus, the objective behind “fanning down” then is to initially move the cars down so that their starting positions can be closer to the center of the map. When greedy lookahead is then applied after, the coverage of the car paths will cover the map more evenly, due to a more central starting position. ","category":"page"},{"location":"algos/","page":"Algorithms","title":"Algorithms","text":"In order to fandown the cars, at each junction the cars will look at the outgoing neighbors and choose to go to the one that traverses in the south direction as much as possible (biggest difference in latitude values).

","category":"page"},{"location":"algos/","page":"Algorithms","title":"Algorithms","text":"As a result, we still want the cars to take streets that lead them south near the center of the map, but we want to probabilistically have them take different streets at each junction. During the fandom process, at each junction the car must traverse a street that has not been visited before with a probability of 1/diff_rand, where diff_rand is a variable that can be fine-tuned. The default value of diff_rand is 5 so at each junction, there is ⅕ probability that the car must choose a street not visited before but has the next highest distance traveled south.

In short, we want to increase coverage as much as possible by sending cars to explore all sides and areas as much as possible. Thus, this approach entails first finding 4 junctions : one at the largest latitude, one at the lowest latitude, one at the largest longitude, and one at the lowest longitude. The rationale is to move the cars in these positions so that they start in areas that cover the north, east, south, and west sections.

To begin, the first 4 cars are sent in the north, east, south, and west positions using Dijkstra's.

In order to ensure we are increasing coverage as much as possible, we want to discourage cars from exploring areas that other cars are already traversing. In order to do so, we first split the map into 4 sections: upper-right, lower-right, lower-left, and upper-left quadrants. Each of the first 4 cars will be assigned to the above sections respectively in that order, where the section bounds are the halfway mark between the maximum and minimum latitude and the halfway mark between the maximum and minimum longitude.

The next step is to run greedy lookahead on the cars.","category":"page"},{"location":"algos/","page":"Algorithms","title":"Algorithms","text":"The greedy lookahead works similar to the one mentioned above except that we use BFS for speed. Additionally, to ensure that the cars are traversing in their respective sections without crossing bounds, if a street leads a car to a junction that crosses its respective section’s boundary, a discount factor is applied to the perceived distance so that the speed appears to be lower in the BFS tree and that street is less likely to get chosen. Again, we also choose unvisited streets first before visited ones.  An interesting artifact that results from the greedy lookahead approach is that sometimes duplicate street paths are taken. For example, let’s say there are junctions 1 and 2. With the algorithm, a car might hypothetically have the following path: [1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 5 ,6...]. Obviously, going from 1 to 2 back to 1 to 2 again is wasted time. As a result, once greedy-lookahead is applied, we inspect to see what duplicates exist and we remove them. We then add back time that was wasted from the duplicates and run the greedy lookahead again with the remaining time that is left.","category":"page"},{"location":"algos/","page":"Algorithms","title":"Algorithms","text":"This is the ideal solution that runs in 20 seconds and achieves a score of 1.65-1.8 million.
